1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a UI library, it creates single page applications that don't completely re-render when data is updated, instead only re-rendering the component.

2. What does it mean to think in react?

To think in react means thinking of building small reusable components, that will be put together to build a larger application.

3. Describe state.

State is an object that stores data and determines how a component behaves.

4. Describe props.

Props allow us to pass state/data to other components.

5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects affect other objects outside of the function scope.  To sync effects, we pass in a dependency array.
